# Operators in C++

## 1. Introduction to Operators in C++

Operators in C++ are symbols that manipulate operands (variables or values) to perform operations like addition, comparison, or logical evaluation. Mastering operators is essential for writing efficient and functional C++ programs.

### Key Concepts:
- **Operands**: The values or variables an operator works on (e.g., in `5 + 3`, `5` and `3` are operands).
- **Precedence**: Determines which operator is evaluated first in an expression (e.g., `*` before `+`).
- **Associativity**: Defines the order of evaluation for operators with the same precedence (left-to-right or right-to-left).
- **Types**: Operators are categorized based on their purpose, such as arithmetic or logical.

C++ operators include:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Increment and Decrement Operators
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
8. Other Operators (e.g., `sizeof`, `&`, `*`)

## 2. Types of Operators in C++

### 2.1. Arithmetic Operators
Perform mathematical operations on numeric operands.
| Operator | Description         | Example         |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `+`      | Addition            | `5 + 3 = 8`     |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `5 - 3 = 2`     |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `5 * 3 = 15`    |
| `/`      | Division            | `6 / 2 = 3`     |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) | `7 % 3 = 1`     |

**Note**: Integer division (`/`) truncates decimal parts (e.g., `7 / 2 = 3`). Use `float` or `double` for precise results (e.g., `7.0 / 2 = 3.5`).

### 2.2. Relational Operators
Compare two values, returning `true` (1) or `false` (0).
| Operator | Description                | Example           |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                   | `5 == 5` (true)   |
| `!=`     | Not equal to               | `5 != 3` (true)   |
| `>`      | Greater than               | `5 > 3` (true)    |
| `<`      | Less than                  | `3 < 5` (true)    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to   | `5 >= 5` (true)   |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to      | `3 <= 5` (true)   |

### 2.3. Logical Operators
Combine boolean conditions.
| Operator | Description                | Example                     |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND (both true)    | `5 > 3 && 2 < 4` (true)     |
| `||`     | Logical OR (either true)   | `5 > 3 || 2 > 4` (true)     |
| `!`      | Logical NOT (inverts)      | `!(5 > 3)` (false)          |

### 2.4. Bitwise Operators
Manipulate individual bits of operands.
| Operator | Description                | Example                     |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `&`      | Bitwise AND                | `5 & 3 = 1` (0101 & 0011 = 0001) |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR                 | `5 | 3 = 7` (0101 | 0011 = 0111) |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR                | `5 ^ 3 = 6` (0101 ^ 0011 = 0110) |
| `~`      | Bitwise NOT                | `~5 = -6` (inverts bits)    |
| `<<`     | Left shift                 | `5 << 1 = 10` (0101 << 1 = 1010) |
| `>>`     | Right shift                | `5 >> 1 = 2` (0101 >> 1 = 0010) |

**Note**: Bitwise operators work on the binary representation of numbers. For example, `5` (binary `0101`) and `3` (binary `0011`) yield `5 & 3 = 0001` (1).

### 2.5. Assignment Operators
Assign values to variables or modify them.
| Operator | Description                | Example                     |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `=`      | Assign                     | `x = 10` (x is 10)          |
| `+=`     | Add and assign             | `x += 5` (x = x + 5)        |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign        | `x -= 3` (x = x - 3)        |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign        | `x *= 2` (x = x * 2)        |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign          | `x /= 2` (x = x / 2)        |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign         | `x %= 3` (x = x % 3)        |


### 2.6. Increment and Decrement Operators
Increase or decrease a variable’s value by 1.
| Operator | Description                | Example                     |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `++`     | Increment                  | `x++` or `++x` (x = x + 1)  |
| `--`     | Decrement                  | `x--` or `--x` (x = x - 1)  |

- **Pre-increment/decrement** (`++x`, `--x`): Modifies the value before it’s used.
- **Post-increment/decrement** (`x++`, `x--`): Uses the value, then modifies it.

**Example**:
```cpp
int x = 5;
cout << ++x; // Outputs 6 (increments first)
cout << x++; // Outputs 6 (uses, then increments to 7)
```

### 2.7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
A concise alternative to `if-else`.
- Syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`
- Example: `int max = (a > b) ? a : b;` (returns `a` if `a > b`, else `b`)

### 2.8. Other Operators
Miscellaneous operators for specific tasks.
| Operator | Description                | Example                     |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `sizeof` | Size of variable/type      | `sizeof(int)` (e.g., 4 bytes)|
| `&`      | Address-of (pointers)      | `&x` (address of x)         |
| `*`      | Dereference (pointers)     | `*ptr` (value at ptr)       |
| `,`      | Comma (multiple expressions)| `x = (y=3, y+2)` (x = 5)    |

---

## 3. Operator Precedence and Associativity

Precedence determines which operator is evaluated first in an expression. For example, multiplication (`*`) has higher precedence than addition (`+`). Parentheses `()` override precedence for clarity.

**Example**:
```cpp
int result = 5 + 3 * 2; // 3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11
int result2 = (5 + 3) * 2; // 5 + 3 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16
```

**Associativity**:
- Most operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are **left-to-right**.
- Assignment operators (e.g., `=`, `+=`) and unary operators (e.g., `++`, `--`) are **right-to-left**.

**Simplified Precedence Table**:
1. `++`, `--`, `!`, `~`, `sizeof`, `&`, `*` (unary)
2. `*`, `/`, `%`
3. `+`, `-`
4. `<<`, `>>`
5. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
6. `==`, `!=`
7. `&`, `^`, `|`
8. `&&`, `||`
9. `?:` (ternary)
10. `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

## 4. Example Program with User Input

This program demonstrates all operator types using user input, building on your previous request for user input handling. It includes error checking (e.g., division by zero) and clear output for beginners.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Variables for user input
    int a, b;
    string username;

    // Taking user input
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, username); // Handles full names with spaces
    cout << "Hello, " << username << "! Enter two integers (a and b): ";
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Arithmetic Operators
    cout << "\n=== Arithmetic Operators ===" << endl;
    cout << a << " + " << b << " = " << (a + b) << endl;
    cout << a << " - " << b << " = " << (a - b) << endl;
    cout << a << " * " << b << " = " << (a * b) << endl;
    cout << a << " / " << b << " = " << (b != 0 ? a / (float)b : "Error: Division by zero") << endl;
    cout << a << " % " << b << " = " << (b != 0 ? a % b : "Error: Modulus by zero") << endl;

    // Relational Operators
    cout << "\n=== Relational Operators ===" << endl;

    // Logical Operators
    cout << "\n=== Logical Operators ===" << endl;
    cout << "(" << a << " > 0 && " << b << " > 0): " << (a > 0 && b > 0 ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    cout << "!(" << a << " == " << b << "): " << (!(a == b) ? "true" : "false") << endl;

    // Bitwise Operators
    cout << "\n=== Bitwise Operators ===" << endl;
    cout << a << " & " << b << ": " << (a & b) << " (binary: " << bitset<8>(a & b) << ")" << endl;
    cout << a << " | " << b << ": " << (a | b) << " (binary: " << bitset<8>(a | b) << ")" << endl;
    cout << a << " ^ " << b << ": " << (a ^ b) << " (binary: " << bitset<8>(a ^ b) << ")" << endl;
    cout << a << " << 1: " << (a << 1) << " (binary: " << bitset<8>(a << 1) << ")" << endl;

    // Assignment Operators
    cout << "\n=== Assignment Operators ===" << endl;
    int temp = a;
    temp += b;
    cout << "a += b: " << temp << endl;
    temp = a;
    temp &= b;
    cout << "a &= b: " << temp << endl;

    // Increment/Decrement Operators
    cout << "\n=== Increment/Decrement Operators ===" << endl;
    cout << "Original a: " << a << endl;
    cout << "Pre-increment (++a): " << ++a << endl;
    cout << "Post-increment (a++): " << a++ << endl;
    cout << "After post-increment, a: " << a << endl;

    // Ternary Operator
    cout << "\n=== Ternary Operator ===" << endl;
    cout << "Larger number: " << (a > b ? a : b) << endl;

    // Other Operators
    cout << "\n=== Other Operators ===" << endl;
    cout << "sizeof(int): " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Address of a: " << &a << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

- **Arithmetic**: Performs all operations with a check for division/modulus by zero using the ternary operator.
- **Relational**: Displays boolean results as "true" or "false" for clarity.
- **Logical**: Combines conditions with readable output.
- **Bitwise**: Includes binary representation (`bitset<8>`) for better understanding.
- **Assignment**: Shows compound assignments with practical examples.
- **Increment/Decrement**: Demonstrates pre- and post-increment differences.
- **Ternary**: Finds the larger number concisely.
- **Other**: Shows `sizeof` and memory address for completeness.

**Pro Features**:
- Error handling for division/modulus by zero.
- Binary output for bitwise operations to aid learning.

## 5. Practice Question

**Question**: Write a C++ program that:
- Takes user input for three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) and a username (string).
- Performs the following operations:
  1. Calculate the average of `a`, `b`, and `c` as a `float` (arithmetic: `+`, `/`).
  2. Check if `a` is greater than `b` and `b` is greater than `c` (logical: `&&`, relational: `>`).
  3. Compute the bitwise AND of `a` and `c` (bitwise: `&`).
  4. Use pre-decrement on `b` (decrement: `--`).
  5. Use the ternary operator to determine if the average is above 50.
  6. Display the memory address of `a` (other: `&`).
- Handle division by zero and display the username with results.

**Sample Output** (for inputs `a = 60`, `b = 50`, `c = 40`):
```
Enter your name: Pankaj
Enter three integers (a, b, c): 60 50 40
Hello, Pankaj!
Average of 60, 50, 40: 50
Is a > b and b > c? Yes
Bitwise AND (a & c): 8
After pre-decrement b: 49
Average above 50? No
Memory address of a: 0x7ffee4c0a4ac
```

**Instructions**:
- Use `getline` for the username and `cin` for integers.
- Cast to `float` for the average calculation.
- Use logical operators for condition checks and ternary for the average check.
- Include error handling for any division operations.

**Sample Solution** (Try writing your own first!):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    string username;

    // Input
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, username);
    cout << "Enter three integers (a, b, c): ";
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    // Calculations
    float average = (a + b + c) / 3.0; // Cast to float for precision
    bool isDescending = (a > b && b > c);
    int bitwiseAnd = a & c;
    int decrementedB = --b;
    bool aboveFifty = (average > 50);

    // Display results
    cout << "Hello, " << username << "!" << endl;
    cout << "Average of " << a << ", " << b << ", " << c << ": " << average << endl;
    cout << "Is a > b and b > c? " << (isDescending ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Bitwise AND (a & c): " << bitwiseAnd << endl;
    cout << "After pre-decrement b: " << decrementedB << endl;
    cout << "Average above 50? " << (aboveFifty ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Memory address of a: " << &a << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 6. Common Mistakes and Best Practices

- **Division by Zero**: Always check for zero before using `/` or `%` (e.g., `b != 0 ? a / b : "Error"`).
- **Pre vs. Post Increment/Decrement**: Pre-increment (`++x`) modifies before use; post-increment (`x++`) modifies after use.
- **Bitwise vs. Logical**: Don’t confuse `&` (bitwise AND) with `&&` (logical AND) or `|` (bitwise OR) with `||` (logical OR).
- **Precedence Errors**: Use parentheses to clarify complex expressions (e.g., `(a + b) * c`).
- **Type Mismatches**: Use `float` or `double` for decimal results in division (e.g., `a / (float)b`).
- **Readable Output**: Format output clearly (e.g., use labels and spacing) to make results beginner-friendly.
