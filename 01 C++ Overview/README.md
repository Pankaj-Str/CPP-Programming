# C++ Overview - Codes with Pankaj

## Introduction

Welcome to "Codes with Pankaj," your go-to resource for mastering programming concepts. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the fundamentals of C++, a powerful and versatile programming language.

### What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979. It is an extension of the C programming language with additional features like classes and objects, making it an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. C++ is widely used for developing system/software infrastructure, game development, embedded systems, and more.

### Why Learn C++?

1. **Versatility:** C++ is a versatile language used in various domains, from system programming to game development.
2. **Performance:** It allows low-level manipulation, making it efficient and suitable for performance-critical applications.
3. **Object-Oriented:** C++ supports object-oriented programming, making code organization and reuse more straightforward.
4. **Community and Resources:** With a vast community and numerous online resources, learning and problem-solving become more accessible.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into coding, let's set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Install a C++ Compiler:** Choose a C++ compiler suitable for your platform. Popular choices include GCC for Linux, MinGW for Windows, and Xcode for macOS.

2. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Select an IDE that supports C++. Options like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, and Eclipse are popular among C++ developers.

3. **Create Your First C++ Program:** Write a simple "Hello, World!" program to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Basic C++ Concepts

### 1. Variables and Data Types

In C++, you declare variables to store data. Each variable has a data type, such as `int` for integers, `double` for floating-point numbers, and `char` for characters.

```cpp
int age = 25;
double pi = 3.14;
char grade = 'A';
```

### 2. Control Flow

C++ supports traditional control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while`. These help in decision-making and looping.

```cpp
if (age >= 18) {
    std::cout << "You are eligible to vote." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "You are not eligible to vote." << std::endl;
}
```

### 3. Functions

Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions for reuse. Here's a simple function to add two numbers:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Conclusion

This is just the beginning of your C++ journey. In the upcoming tutorials, we'll explore more advanced concepts, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
