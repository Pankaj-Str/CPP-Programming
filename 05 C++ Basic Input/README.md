# Taking User Input in C++

This tutorial explains how to take user input in C++ using `cin` from the `<iostream>` library. We’ll cover the basics, provide an example, and include a practice question to reinforce the concept. By the end, you’ll understand how to read different types of input from users in C++.

## 1. Introduction to User Input in C++

In C++, the standard way to take user input is by using the `cin` object, which is part of the `<iostream>` library. The `cin` object reads input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard) and stores it in variables.

To use `cin`, you need to:
- Include the `<iostream>` header.
- Use the `std` namespace (either by adding `using namespace std;` or by prefixing with `std::`).
- Declare a variable to store the input.

The general syntax for `cin` is:

```cpp
cin >> variable;
```

You can read multiple inputs in a single line by chaining the `>>` operator:

```cpp
cin >> variable1 >> variable2;
```

## 2. Steps to Take User Input

1. **Include the necessary header**:
   Add `#include <iostream>` at the top of your program.

2. **Use the `std` namespace**:
   Either include `using namespace std;` or use `std::` before `cin` and `cout`.

3. **Declare a variable**:
   Define a variable of the appropriate data type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `string`) to store the input.

4. **Prompt the user**:
   Use `cout` to display a message asking for input.

5. **Read the input**:
   Use `cin` to capture the user’s input and store it in the variable.

## 3. Example Program

Below is a C++ program that demonstrates how to take user input for different data types (integer, float, and string) and display them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string> // Required for string data type
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declare variables to store input
    int age;
    float height;
    string name;

    // Prompt user for input
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, name); // Use getline for strings with spaces

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    cout << "Enter your height (in meters): ";
    cin >> height;

    // Display the input
    cout << "\n--- User Details ---" << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << " years" << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << " meters" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example
- **Headers**: We include `<iostream>` for `cin` and `cout`, and `<string>` for the `string` data type.
- **Namespace**: `using namespace std;` simplifies the use of `cin`, `cout`, and `string`.
- **Input**:
  - `getline(cin, name)` is used for the string input to capture the full name, including spaces.
  - `cin >> age` and `cin >> height` read integer and float inputs, respectively.
- **Output**: The program displays the entered details using `cout`.

### Sample Output
```
Enter your name: Pankaj Sharma
Enter your age: 25
Enter your height (in meters): 1.75

--- User Details ---
Name: Pankaj Sharma
Age: 25 years
Height: 1.75 meters
```

## 4. Handling Different Input Types

Here’s how to handle common data types with `cin`:

- **Integer (`int`)**: `cin >> variable;` (e.g., `int num; cin >> num;`)
- **Float/Double (`float`, `double`)**: `cin >> variable;` (e.g., `float price; cin >> price;`)
- **String (`string`)**:
  - For single words: `cin >> variable;` (e.g., `string word; cin >> word;`)
  - For full lines (including spaces): `getline(cin, variable);`
- **Character (`char`)**: `cin >> variable;` (e.g., `char initial; cin >> initial;`)

**Note**: When using `cin` followed by `getline`, you may need to clear the input buffer using `cin.ignore()` to avoid skipping the `getline` input. Example:

```cpp
int num*.
cin >> num;
cin.ignore(); // Clear the newline character from the input buffer
string name;
getline(cin, name);
```

## 5. Practice Question (codeswithpankaj.com)

**Question**: Write a C++ program to take user input for the following:
- A student’s name (full name, including spaces).
- Their roll number (integer).
- Their percentage marks (float).
The program should calculate and display whether the student has passed (marks >= 40) or failed, along with their details.

**Instructions**:
- Use `getline` for the name.
- Display the result in the format:
  ```
  Student Name: [name]
  Roll Number: [roll]
  Percentage: [marks]%
  Result: [Pass/Fail]
  ```
- Share your solution at **codeswithpankaj.com** or in the comments section!

**Sample Solution** (Try writing your own before checking!):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int roll;
    float marks;

    cout << "Enter student name: ";
    getline(cin, name);
    cout << "Enter roll number: ";
    cin >> roll;
    cout << "Enter percentage marks: ";
    cin >> marks;

    cout << "\nStudent Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Roll Number: " << roll << endl;
    cout << "Percentage: " << marks << "%" << endl;
    cout << "Result: " << (marks >= 40 ? "Pass" : "Fail") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
