Introduction:
Welcome to "Codes with Pankaj," where we explore the world of programming together. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the fundamentals of C++ programming, focusing specifically on basic input operations. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or someone brushing up on their skills, this tutorial is designed to help you understand how to take input in C++.

Let's get started!

**Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment**
Before we start coding, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Popular choices include GCC, Visual C++, and Code::Blocks. Choose the one that suits your preferences.

**Step 2: Creating a C++ Program**
Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to create a new C++ file. Save it with a ".cpp" extension. For example, "basic_input.cpp."

**Step 3: Writing Your First C++ Program**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Your code will go here

    return 0;
}
```

**Step 4: Including the Necessary Header File**
In C++, the `iostream` library is essential for handling input and output operations. Add the following line inside the `#include` directives to include it in your program.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

**Step 5: Declaring Variables**
Before taking input, you need a variable to store the entered value. Declare a variable using an appropriate data type. For example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable to store user input
    int user_input;

    return 0;
}
```

**Step 6: Taking Input**
Now, let's take input from the user using the `std::cin` stream. Add the following lines inside the `main` function:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable to store user input
    int user_input;

    // Prompt the user to enter a value
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";

    // Take input from the user
    std::cin >> user_input;

    return 0;
}
```

**Step 7: Displaying the Input**
To verify that the input was successful, let's display the entered value. Add the following lines after taking input:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable to store user input
    int user_input;

    // Prompt the user to enter a value
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";

    // Take input from the user
    std::cin >> user_input;

    // Display the entered value
    std::cout << "You entered: " << user_input << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Step 8: Compile and Run**
Save your program and compile it using your chosen C++ compiler. Run the executable and test your basic input program.
